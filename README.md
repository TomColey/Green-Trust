# Green-Trust
The Role of Product Packaging in Promoting Sustainable Consumption: An Investigation of the Impact of Packaging Elements on ‘Green Trust’.


## Project Overview

This repository contains the Python analysis scripts for a study on the influence of product packaging design on sustainable consumption. It focuses on how specific design elements, such as colour, imagery, and typography, affect consumer trust in the environmental claims of a product.

## Research Context

The study explored the role of product packaging in promoting sustainable consumption by investigating how specific elements of product packaging design influence 'Green Trust' among consumers. The study employs a quantitative research design rooted in Signalling Theory, utilising a pairwise ranking method to gauge consumer trust towards environmentally friendly packaging designs. The research focused on three primary variables: colour, imagery, and typography, across a sample of 150 UK consumers.

## Data Collection

The data folder contains anonymised results from the online survey. Personal identifiers have been removed to protect participant privacy. The survey employed pairwise comparison methodology, asking participants to rate their trust in the product's sustainability based solely on visual design elements presented.

## Analysis Scripts

This repository includes two Python scripts that carry out a comprehensive statistical analysis of the survey data:

- `descriptive-statistics.py`: Generates descriptive statistics that summarize the dataset's distribution, such as mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range.

- `inferential-statistics_regression-analysis.py`: Conducts inferential statistical tests to determine the significance of differences between design elements and calculates effect sizes. It also performs regression analysis to predict consumer trust and provides data visualisations for a more intuitive understanding of the results.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis scripts:
1. Ensure Python is installed along with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib.
2. Clone the repository to your machine.
3. Run the scripts from the command line.

```bash
python descriptive-statistics.py
python inferential-statistics_regression-analysis.py
```
